Maven is a tool for build automation and package management
We have to import packages all the time to have our applications
Java has a lot of packages already built into it collections
The native Java packages get to be cool and use java.anything.anything


the old school way to add new packages and Java code to an application
was to down a .jar file and manually build it into your classpath when 
designing an application. This is very tedious and prone to error. You were responsible
for keeping the program updated if one packages changed

Maven will do build automation update packages for us
The heart of Maven is the pom.xml

pom.xml (Project Object Model) A configuration file for your Java Application.
It will contain things such as the name  of the project. The packages used in the project
what version of Java to compile the project as. If you want the tests youve written for
it to be run automatically when the application is built
