Web Server-  is a computer that is designed to handle
HTTP requests. 

Servlet- Is a Java object designed to handle incoming requests
not solely HTTP. Servlets can generate responses and 
process requests using Java Logic

Servlet Container-  It contains one to many Servlets and is primarily
responsible for mapping the servlets to different addresses. Configure
our servlets

Tomcat - Is a server designed by Apache that will host or house
our servlet Container.

web.xml (Deploymeny Descriptor) - Gives the servlet Container
mapping and configuration details
decides what requests are handled by a servlet


Servlet Lifecycle
1. Servlet Class is loaded into the servlet Container
2. Servlet Clss is instantiated
3. Servlet's init() method is called the init method() of the servlet
class is run only once and sets up intial configuration/parameters
-Lazy init() is called upon the reqeust to a servlet
-Eager init() is called as soon as the application starts
4. Servlet service() method is called upon each request to the 
servlet. The service() method delegates the request to 
doGet(), doPost(), doDelete().......
5. Servlet destroy() method is only called once and that is when
the application is shut down

ServletConfig - is an object specific to a single servlet
that holds information on that servlet

ServletContext - is an object that hold information about the
entire servlet container and thus all servlets

uri - Uniform Resource Identifier
- identies a file or resource/servlet

url - Unifirm Resource Locator
host + port + uri 

Forward- occurs on the server side and sends a request from one
servlet to another.

Redirect- is when a resource tells the client to send another
request to different

Session Handling

1. HttpSession object- this will keep track of the session server side
2. Cookies- to store information client side
