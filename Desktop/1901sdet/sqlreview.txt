RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
software designed to manage a Database

Database-a collection of objects designed to hold information

Relational databse - A database which holds information in tables
related to each other

table - composed of columns called fields which hold attributes
and rows called records which model an instance 

SQL - Structured Query Language 

DDL (Data Definition Language) - Defines the rules and structures
truncate, create, alter drop

DML (Data Manipulation Language) - Adds removes or edits data in the
database insert delete set update

DQL (Data Query Language) - for reading information
SELECT

DCL (Data Control Language) - for granting permissions to users

TCL(Transaction control Language) - for generating transactions 
commit, rollback, savepoint

clauses in SQL
Where - specific condition to be met
GROUP by - arrange results into bundles/groups used for aggregate functions
having - used with group by because you cannot use where
order by - rearranges the presentaion of the results but not what records are returned
and/or - conditionals

constraints- rules that we put on a table
Primary key - Unique identifier for a records
(composite key) - combination of two or more columns to create a primary key

Foreign key- establishes a relationship to another table
the table that has the foreign key is the child

Unique- all values must be Unique

default - set default value for a column

not null- value cannot be null

referential integrity - the use of keys to prevent ophan records

orphan records - reocrds who reference a record/parent who no longer
exists

PL/SQL

Procedure - Is a set of SQL commands/code that is essentially a script
a procedure can have 0 to any number of inputs. 0 to any number of outputs
Can actually change values in the database
compiled once and stored

function- has at least one input. Always one output
never changes data in the database
compiled each time

trigger- code to be executed when a certain event occurs on a table

multiplicities
1-1
1-many
many-many junction table

Sequence - database object to generate numbers


normalization - process of reducing redundancy in a database
(not always what we want)

1nf- 
All data is atomic. 
Each record is uniquely identifiable i.e. primary key

2nf- in 1nf and there are no functional dependencies
(You cannot calculate the value of another field)

3nf- in 2nf and there are not transitive dependencies
(You cannot find that value anywhere else in the database)

tranactions- A logical unit of sql commands
oracle transactions obey ACID

A - atomic all statements in a transaction succeed or none of them drop
C - consistency the database moves from one consistent commited state to another
I - Isolation concurrent transactions do not cause consistency issues*
D - Durable transactions fail gracefully and do not cause your database to crash or some othe awful happening

Isolation levels-
read uncommited - cardinal sin of databases  
allows for dirty reads reading uncommited data

read commited - allows for non repeatable reads
a record found at the start of the transaction cannot be found at the end

repeatable read - allows for phantom reads
a record not found at the begining of the transaction is found at the end

serializable - allows for no consistency errors
is slow becuase transactions cannot run concurrently

joins - combine two tables horizontally based on some type of predicate 
ie. "on player.team = team.name"

left join
right join
cross join cartesian product
natural join
inner join
full outer join
outer join
theta join a predicate other than equals

unions - combine two tables vertically 
they have the same number and type of columns

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
A java library with classes to connect to a database
interfaces of JDBC

Connection -- used to connect to a database
PreparedStatement protects against sql injection and sanitizes inputs to the sql query
Statement -- just pure sql string
CallableStatement -- used for calling procedures
ResultSet -- stores the results from a query
