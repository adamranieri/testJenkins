Thread is the smallest units of command that can be executed
Think of them a small process

Multithreading is a technique in which we use multiple threads and multiple processors
To speed up calculation and efficiency

Code execute in parallel

In Java you have daemon thread which is the main thread. When this thread ends the program
is over. This thread can generate other threads. daemon spawns are child threads

Thread Lifecycle
new - A thread is created
runnable - A thread is able to be run but is not necessarily doing anything
running - A thread is executing
terminated - The thread is done

blocked- prevented from running for some reason. Usually a thread conflict

Scheduler- Responsible for blocking and freeing threads and tying to optimize
thread throughput


Deadlock - Hostage exchange where neither thread trusts each other. Each thread
has resource that the other one wants but will grant access to their own resource
until the other one does

Livelock - Canadian lock both threads are too polite and are trying to give the other
thread priority to use their resource

priority - is essentially the order in which a thread should go. 
min priority is 1
max priority is 10
