JavaScript to Java
Hamster to Ham

Java
- Statically typed. A variable's type has to be declared 
i.e. int num x = 100;

- Server side language
You see it on the backend of web applications
exception is jsp 

-Compiled language
we write code and then it compiles 
and the result is what you actually run

- Has classes and classical inheritence
we use classes as blueprints to create objects

- Java has access modifiers

- has 4 scopes

- is only pass by value

- very OOP based

JavaScript
- Loosely Typed  You do need not to delare a variables type 
x = 100;

- Pimarily a client side language
node.js is being used to write server side JavaScript

- Scripting language (Just in Time Compilation) JIT
the program compiles and runs at the same time

-No classes and has protypical inheritence
an object refernces another object as a protype to build off of
* ES6 ECMA added a Class keyword to simulate classes in js

- no access modifiers 

- JavaScript has 3 but we should only really use two

- DataTypes primitives and objects
a function is an object

- JS is both pass by value and pass by reference

- Multi-Paradigmed programming language
it has oop capabilities it is heavily influenced by funtional
programming
