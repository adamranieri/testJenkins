JavaScript Review
- Scripting language, just in time compiled, compiles and runs
simultaneously
- Dynanmic/loose/interprative typing 
- Multi paradigmed language (Functional with support for oop)
- no classes and therefore cannot have classical inheritence

js is a single threaded language

prototypical
- You create an object and then that object is the base
for another object

Data Types in JavaScript

primitives are pass by value - 
String, Number, null, undefined, boolean
Objects are pass by reference- object, array, function 

variable scopes
- global no declaration
- function var
- block let const

Hoisting
'feature' wherein declarations are hoisted to the top of the 
scope but not the actual value

functions-
 1. are Objects
 2. can be anonymous 
 3. can be hoisted

self invoking functions (function(){some code})()

arrow notation let foo = (param) =>{}

callback function - it is a function passed in as a parameter


closure - is when a function with a function has access to variables
defined in the outer function

template literal- denoted by `` backticks
way of storing string inforamtion provides for
interpolation

Objects- key value pairs


let person = {
    name : "adam"
    profession : "trainer"
    hello: function(){
        some code
    } 
}
person.train

JSON vs JSO

JSO-key value pairs used for performing and programming 

JSON - Just a string format 
{"name":"Adam", "age":19}

JSON do not contain functions
The purpose of a JSON is to provide a very easy and common
format for programmers to communicate with

truthy falsy 
JavaScript type coercion at play
== which performs type coercion
=== which does not

NaN is always even against itself.


DOM 
- Document Object Model
connected nodes or tree

eventlisteners- Its a trap set on an element or action that happens
on the page. 

element.addEventListener("event", code to excute, bubble?)

bubbling is when js executes from the innermost element outer
capturing is the outermost element in

Make an ajax call
1. Make an xmlhttprrequest object
2. onreadystatechange  needs to be given a function to execute
3. open the object (http verb and url)
4. you need to send it

HTML -
Hyper Text Markup language
not a programming language

elements - building blocks for web page
attributes - properties for elements adjectives

css
Cascading Style Sheets
make your webpages look nice

cascade algorithm- Determines what ultimate style is applied to 
an element the most specific style is applied

selctors
id 
class 
tag
