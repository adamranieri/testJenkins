Selenium - A suite of tools aimed at automation (used predominantly for testing)

Selenium IDE 

Selenium Client API - Support for writing Selenium in many languages

Selenium Remote Control - Server that allows for writing web application tests
in any language

Selenium Grid - A server that can test using many machines running in parallel

Selenium Webdriver - A serverless way to execute your tests. The heart of modern 
Selenium. Starts a browser instance and controls it. 

You need different drivers for each type of browser

Selenium Locators
by id
by name
by class
by xpath Why is xpath not the best?
by css selector
by tag name


implicit wait - is a set amount of time that Selenium will wait to grab any element
before throwing an exception that it cannot be found
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitwait(seconds)
set how long to wait for any element

explicit wait - Selenium has been told specifically for a single element how long to wait

POM (Page Object Model)

We create a Java Class whose fields represent elements in a web Page
We use the POM to help organize our code and abstract getting elements
Makes code extensible and easy to read

PageFactory which can be used create POM's 
I am not a fan

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TestNG is a superset of JUnit
TestNextGeneration
- we can set priorities to easilydetermine the order in which our test run. 
- And the ability to run tests in parallel



-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cucumber is a BDD framework
Behavior Driven Development
TDD- Test Driven Development. You write to help guide your design Development
BDD is an extension of TDD where you write user stories/ features to be implmented
imagine it as an end user going to use your application
- Develop failing acceptance tests until they pass



Cucumber Feature file 

Feature: describe the feauture or segment of functionality /part of website you are testing
high level description of the software feature

background: is ised to provide context to our software feature

Scenario : defines steps to be written in Gherkin


Gherkin  is a very high level language which is essentially english.
it provides a structure for our code to implement. Gherkin will generate
the method signature for a test called the step implentations

Given: Some set of preconditions
When: some set of action(s)
Then: some sort of test/ obeservable outcome

Scenario Outline
Allows you to pass in variables to test the Scenario with multiple inputs

in the Scenario outline
"<variable>"

Example:

|variable|
| value  |

To write Cucumber BDD test
1. Write a feature file
2. implement the step implentations created by the feature file
3. You have to put the stepimplemations and feature in a test runner
@CucumberOptions glue code

Jasmine

Testing framework for JavaScript

describe - describe the test suite
it - a specific test or spec
expect - creates an expectation
toBe - assertion

Matchers 

toEqual
toBeLessThan
toBeGreaterThan
toBeFalse
toBeTrue
toBeTruthy 
tobBeFalsy
toBeNaN
toContain
toBeToClose

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Protractor
end to end testing
- e2e testing framework designed for angular application
if you dont mention it is specifically for are Angular
- You can use on non angular pages

conf.js - Selenium address, location of specs
spec.js - your specs/tests

with Protractor you host a server for Selenium
in java it was serverless

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Smoke testing
running tests just to see if your application is even in a state to be tested
