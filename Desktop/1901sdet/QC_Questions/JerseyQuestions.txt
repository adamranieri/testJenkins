jersey questions-

What is Jersey
Java framework for rest API
configured using a web.xml and annotations
Built on top of the JAX-RS api


How do I mark a model class for XML marshalling (@XmlRootElement)

How would I set up a resource that processes a 
post that recieves JSON information and returns xml

@POST
@Consumes(MediaType.Application_JSON)
@Produces(MediaType.Application_XML)
myMethod(){
//code
}

what is the difference betwen @MatrixParm @PathParam and @QueryParam
they are different ways to send information in the URL

Can mention how the uri looks
@MatrixParam uses values resource/name=adam;age=19
@PathParam  resource/adam
@QueryParam resource/name?adam

What does @Context do
allows us to get information either from the request like the headers
or from the servlet/serlet container
