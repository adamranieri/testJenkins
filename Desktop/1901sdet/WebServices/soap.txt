Simple Object Access Protocol

It is another form of a web service
Relies on a WSDL

Web Service Definition/Description Language it is a contract
It tells the client what this service can do and how to access this service

SOAP web service can be designed/created contract first or contract last
contract first is you create a WSDL and then code to that WSDL

Contract you create your web service and use that to make the WSDL

SOAP web services generate a strong coupling between the server and the client

As long as the client has a WSDL you will have all the information you need
to use a SOAP Web Service


WSDL is written in XML

<definitions> this is the root tag it defines the web service

<service> defines the endpoint URL of the Web Service

<binding> explains how an operaion will be communicated to or from a web service.
with SOAP you can any protocol, you can use HTTP you can BAM, SMP, UDP

<operation> It is a method within you web service <input> for that method
and the <output> for that method. Or if something goes wrong <fault>

<message> complete set of parameters 

<types> will break down any custom type(class) that you are using in your service
into primitives

<porttype> will encapusulate your operation tag. 


SOAP message

- it communicates soley in the language of XML
- XML provides a stand lingua franca for communctaion in SOAP




REST vs SOAP

REST                                                    SOAP

- Architectural style                                -Protocol

- no context/not contract                            -Contract based   WSDL
hopefully documention in some
form will tell me how to use endpoints

- JSON,XML,TXT,HTML anything                         -XML

- low bandwidth A JSON is                             - Each SOAP envelope is pretty  
pretty small                                            all the structing xml sent with any message

-Cacheable                                             - SOAP is not

-HTTP                                                  - Any protocol

- low coupling bewteen the                             - Tight coupling
service and the client
